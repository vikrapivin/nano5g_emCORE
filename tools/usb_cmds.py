"""usb_cmds.py -- SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the emCORE USB debug command numbers (shared table; this bundle is the
nano 5G kernel: on it, commands 120..131 are the Rockbox-driver NAND harness of target/ipodnano5g/nand5g.h and
132..134 the module loader of module5g.h, see tools/n5g_nand.py / tools/n5g_module.py; the 4G notes below are kept as
the table's history).

Must match the C enum in emCORE/emCORE/usb/usbdebug.c. Host code (libemcore.py, n4g_nand.py) imports Cmd from
here instead of hardcoding numbers.

PROTOCOL OVERVIEW
=================
The usbdebug dispatcher routes a command number to ONE of two switch blocks:
  * the SYNC switch (usbdebug_handle_data, DBGSTATE_SETUP), handled inline in USB IRQ context;
  * the ASYNC switch (dbgthread), the stock emCORE monitor commands.
The SYNC switch is matched FIRST; any number not in it falls through to the ASYNC switch, so sync numbers must not
collide with stock async numbers. Every reply is a 16-byte header (word 0 = response code 1 OK / 2 UNSUPPORTED /
3 BUSY, words 1..3 results) plus an optional payload (READ_MEM, READ_CONSOLE, I2C read).

NAND PROOF OF CONCEPT (2026-10-17, )
========================================================
Commands 120..127 drive target/ipodnano4g/nand_poc.c. Each only queues a job for the NAND worker thread and
returns at once (reply word 1 = accept code, word 2 = job id, word 3 = status record address); NAND_STATUS
returns {status record address, size, result buffer address}. The host polls the status record and reads the
result buffer with READ_MEM. Heartbeat (async 200) words 2/3 = NAND state word / FIL page counter.
